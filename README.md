# Monopoly Stats

Monopoly stats is an in-depth exploration of the statistics behind the board game Monopoly.

## monopoly.ipynb
This is the main file you should be looking at for this project, it includes a number of visualizations and explanations of the data collected through this project.

## monopoly.py
This file is the simulation I used to collect the data which is analyzed in monopoly.ipynb. It contains all of the rules of monopoly, and while it can make a simulated man jump around the board it doesn't do the spending money stuff that happens in an actual game.

## monopoly.csv and prices.csv
These files contain the raw data partially generated by monopoly.py and analyzed in monopoly.ipynb
